# Introduction to tensorflow Udacity course

Learned how to build deep learning applications with TensorFlow. 
The course provided a practical approach to deep learning for software developers. 
Solved hands-on experience building state-of-the-art image classifiers and other deep learning models.  
Learned how to deploy and use advanced techniques and algorithms to work with large datasets. 

Lesson 1:Introduction to Machine Learning
A high level overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

Lesson 2:Fashion MNIST
Built a neural network that can recognise images of articles of clothing.

Lesson 3:Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Used a convolutional network to build more efficient models for Fashion MNIST.

Lesson 4:Going further with CNNs
Expanded my image classifiers into models that can predict from multiple classes.
Used a convolutional network to build a classifier for more detailed color images.

Lesson 5:Transfer Learning
Used a pre-trained network to build powerful state-of-the-art classifiers.

Lesson 6:Saving and Loading models 
Looked at the new SAVEDMODEL format in TnesorFlow 2.0.

Lesson 7:Time Series Forecasting
Learning from Sequential data with recurrent neural networks.
Discovered common patterns in a time Series. 
Used Naive Forecasting, Moving Average, Time Windows, Stateful and Stateless RNNs, and LSTM RNN.
